function result = F_T_max(k, m, N, q_BSM, q_link)
% F_T_max recursively computes the CDF of the maximum completion time T_max
% for a hierarchical (multi-level) quantum repeater system.
%
% INPUTS:
%   k      - integer value at which F_T_max(k) is evaluated
%   m      - recursion level (e.g., m=1 means one level above physical links)
%   N      - number of qubits (nodes) at each level
%   q_BSM  - success probability of Bell State Measurement (BSM)
%   q_link - success probability of stablishing elementary link
%
% OUTPUT:
%   result - the computed value of F_T_max(k)

if m == 1
    F_T_k = 0;  % Initialize the sum for CDF of T_max at level m=1
